# Customer_Journey_Analysis
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on behavioral and demographic data from the Bank Marketing Dataset. A Streamlit dashboard is built to visualize and evaluate clustering results, helping stakeholders better understand customer groups.

Objective
Segment customers using clustering techniques such as K-Means and DBSCAN.

Reduce dimensionality using PCA and t-SNE for better visualization.

Predict customer outcomes (y column) using a Random Forest Classifier.

Evaluate clustering quality using Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.

Running the customer_journey_analysis.py file will give us the models required
